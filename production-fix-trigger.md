# Production Database Fix - Deployment Trigger

## Changes Made
- Updated server/initDb.ts to add all missing database columns during startup
- Added source, youtube_id, is_learn_tube, is_pro_tube, can_run_ads, video_type columns
- This ensures production database has all required columns on server startup

## Expected Fix
Once production server restarts:
1. All missing columns will be automatically added to production database
2. API endpoints will work correctly (videos, trending, recommended)
3. YouTube embed system will be operational
4. All 500 errors will be resolved

## Status
Ready for production deployment - this fix will resolve all database column issues.
