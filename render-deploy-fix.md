# Render Deployment Fix for ProFlix Categories

## Issue
Categories not loading on production: https://proflix-backend.onrender.com/
- Setup API works: `{"message":"Setup complete"}`
- Categories API fails: `{"message":"Failed to fetch categories"}`

## Root Cause
Database tables don't exist on production server. Render needs manual schema initialization.

## Solution

### 1. Update Render Build Command
In your Render dashboard, change the build command to:
```bash
npm install && npm run db:push && npm run build
```

### 2. Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in Render:
- `DATABASE_URL` (your Neon database URL)
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`

### 3. Manual Fix (if build command doesn't work)
Connect to Render shell and run:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### 4. Verify Fix
After deployment:
1. Check: https://proflix-backend.onrender.com/api/categories
2. Should return array of categories instead of error message

## Categories That Will Load
Once fixed, your site will display:
- Art (Tattooing, Digital Art, Painting)
- Fitness (Weightlifting, Yoga, Martial Arts)
- Entrepreneurship (Real Estate, E-commerce, Branding)
- Beauty (Skincare, Makeup, Hair Tutorials)
- Construction (Plumbing, Electrical, Carpentry)
- Music (Singing, DJ Sets, Instrument Lessons)
- Film & Media (Acting, Directing, VFX Editing)
- Food (Cooking, Baking, Food Reviews)
- Sports (Basketball, Football, Skateboarding)
- Dating & Lifestyle (Dating Tips, Self-Improvement, Travel)

## Status
✅ Database auto-initialization added to server startup
✅ All dependencies resolved
✅ Build process working
⏳ Waiting for Render database schema initialization
