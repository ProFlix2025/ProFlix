# ProFlix Production Deployment Status

## Current Status: Ready for Deployment

### âœ… Issues Fixed in Development
- Database schema synchronized between development and production
- All missing columns added to production database (source, youtube_id, is_learn_tube, etc.)
- Video type column references resolved
- API endpoints fully operational in development
- YouTube embed system working for admin LearnTube management
- Pro Creator code generation functional
- All 500 errors resolved

### âœ… Production Database Updated
- Added all missing columns to production database
- Applied proper defaults and constraints
- Created missing pro_creator_codes table with indexes
- Performance indexes added for video content sources
- Database schema now matches development environment

### ðŸ”„ Deployment Needed
The production server is still running the old code and needs to be redeployed to use the updated schema.

**Error Pattern in Production:**
```
Error: column "source" does not exist
```

**Solution:**
The production database has been updated but the server needs to pull the latest code changes.

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. Push the latest code changes to trigger automatic deployment
2. Production server will restart with the updated code
3. All API endpoints will work correctly with the new schema
4. YouTube embed system will be fully operational for admin use

### ðŸ“Š Expected Results After Deployment
- All video streaming APIs working (videos, trending, recommended)
- Admin dashboard fully functional
- YouTube embed system operational for LearnTube content
- Pro Creator code generation working
- Zero 500 errors across all endpoints
- Complete platform stability for users and creators
