# ProFlix Production Deployment Fix

## Issue Summary
Categories not loading on https://proflix-backend.onrender.com/ - API returns "Failed to fetch categories"

## Root Cause
Production database tables don't exist. Local development works perfectly with all 10 categories.

## Complete Solution

### 1. Update Render Build Command
Change build command to:
```bash
./build-render.sh
```

### 2. Manual Database Fix (Immediate)
Since the current deployment has issues, run this in Render shell:
```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

### 3. Force Redeploy
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click "Manual Deploy" > "Deploy latest commit"
3. Wait for build to complete

### 4. Verify Success
After deployment, test:
- https://proflix-backend.onrender.com/api/categories
- Should return JSON array with 10 categories

## Expected Categories
```json
[
  {"id":1,"name":"Art","slug":"art","description":"Creative arts..."},
  {"id":2,"name":"Fitness","slug":"fitness","description":"Health..."},
  {"id":3,"name":"Entrepreneurship","slug":"entrepreneurship"...},
  {"id":4,"name":"Beauty","slug":"beauty"...},
  {"id":5,"name":"Construction","slug":"construction"...},
  {"id":6,"name":"Music","slug":"music"...},
  {"id":7,"name":"Film & Media","slug":"film-media"...},
  {"id":8,"name":"Food","slug":"food"...},
  {"id":9,"name":"Sports","slug":"sports"...},
  {"id":10,"name":"Dating & Lifestyle","slug":"dating-lifestyle"...}
]
```

## If Problem Persists
1. Check Render logs for database connection errors
2. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is set
3. Manually run database initialization:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://proflix-backend.onrender.com/api/db-push
   curl -X POST https://proflix-backend.onrender.com/api/setup
   ```

## Technical Details
- Database: PostgreSQL via Neon
- ORM: Drizzle with auto-schema creation
- Categories: 10 main categories with 3 subcategories each
- Auto-initialization: Server creates tables and populates data on startup
