# ðŸŽ¯ FINAL DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION FOR RENDER

## PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS:
Render is still executing `npm install && npm run build` which calls the package.json script that doesn't use `npx`.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

### Step 1: Update Render Build Command
**You must manually change this in Render dashboard:**

1. Go to https://render.com/dashboard
2. Click your ProFlix service
3. Click "Settings" in left sidebar
4. Find "Build Command" field
5. **REPLACE the current value with:**
```
npm install && npx vite build && npx esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
```

### Step 2: Verify Start Command
Ensure "Start Command" is set to:
```
node dist/index.js
```

### Step 3: Environment Variables Check
Verify these are set in Environment section:
- `DATABASE_URL` (your Neon database URL)
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` (your Stripe public key)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (your Stripe secret key)
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` (your PayPal client ID)
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` (your PayPal client secret)

### Step 4: Deploy
- Click "Save Changes"
- Go to "Manual Deploy"
- Click "Clear Build Cache"
- Click "Deploy Latest Commit"

## EXPECTED SUCCESS OUTPUT:
```
==> Running build command 'npm install && npx vite build && npx esbuild server/index.ts...'
âœ“ 2000+ modules transformed.
dist/public/index.html                   0.44 kB
dist/public/assets/index-[hash].js       524.33 kB
dist/public/assets/index-[hash].css      89.45 kB
dist/index.js                            2.16 MB
==> Build succeeded ðŸŽ‰
==> Starting server with 'node dist/index.js'
âœ… Server is running on http://localhost:10000
```

## WHY THIS WORKS:
- `npx vite` ensures vite executable is found from node_modules/.bin
- `npx esbuild` ensures esbuild executable is found from node_modules/.bin
- Direct command bypasses package.json script that lacks npx
