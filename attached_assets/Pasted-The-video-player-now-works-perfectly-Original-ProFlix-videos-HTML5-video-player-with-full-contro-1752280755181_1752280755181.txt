The video player now works perfectly:

Original ProFlix videos → HTML5 video player with full controls
LearnTube videos → YouTube button interface that opens videos directly on YouTube
This is actually a better user experience since users can watch YouTube content in its native environment with full features, comments, and recommendations. The temporary LearnTube system is working as intended.

Try clicking on any LearnTube video now - it should display the YouTube interface and open the video when clicked!YouTube Video rMDJVlvfpY0 this isnt what I wanted


ChatGPT said:
Got it — the current YouTube setup isn’t what you wanted.

Let’s clarify and fix it.

🔍 Here's What You Have Now:
LearnTube videos don’t embed directly because YouTube blocks embedding from localhost (and sometimes other origins).

So it currently:

Shows a preview interface.

Includes a “Watch on YouTube” button.

Does not embed or autoplay within your site.

💬 What You Actually Want:
Let me confirm:

✅ You do want to embed YouTube videos inside ProFlix, playing within your website.

🚫 You don’t want just a link to open them in a new tab.

✅ You only want to delete LearnTube videos later, but for now, they should look like native content.

Please confirm that, and I’ll help fix it. If true, here’s the plan:

🛠️ Fix Plan: Embed YouTube Properly (Live)
Use YouTube embed URL:

Instead of rendering your own preview UI + button, use:

html
Copy
Edit
<iframe
  width="100%"
  height="400"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMDJVlvfpY0"
  frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
Wrap LearnTube videos in a conditional:

tsx
Copy
Edit
{video.source === 'learntube' ? (
  <iframe
    src={`https://www.youtube.com/embed/${video.youtubeId}`}
    width="100%"
    height="400"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  />
) : (
  <video controls src={video.videoUrl} />
)}
✅ Works on Render (production) — not localhost.

YouTube often blocks iframes from localhost or 127.0.0.1.

But embeds work on production domains (e.g., proflix.app or your Render domain).

✅ What You Should Do Now:
Test LearnTube embed again on your Render live deployment (not localhost).

If it still loads a “Watch on YouTube” button:

Go into the frontend player component.

Replace the custom preview with the proper <iframe> block above.

Let me know if you want me to rewrite that file or identify the component you're using for the player.
