🧠 BACKEND ROUTES (suggested)
bash
Copy
Edit
GET /videos                → Fetch free videos

🧰 MISC SETUP TO AVOID ISSUES
Fix __dirname in ES modules using:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
Vite config should use the proper root and output folders:

ts
Copy
Edit
root: path.resolve(__dirname, 'client'),
build: {
  outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist/public'),
  emptyOutDir: true,
},
Be sure to add Stripe public key to .env and use it in the frontend via import.meta.env.VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY.
