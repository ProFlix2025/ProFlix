Make sure you're using the proper embed code
Format:

html
Copy
Edit
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Test the embed directly

Paste the iframe into a blank .html file on your site and open it.

If it still doesn’t load → YouTube is blocking it (likely due to settings or domain trust).

Check the video’s YouTube settings

Go to YouTube Studio → Content → Click the video.

Under "Permissions" or "Advanced Settings":

Make sure: ✅ “Allow embedding” is enabled.

Video must be Public or Unlisted. Private = embed won't work.

Domain now uses HTTPS?

Confirm that your domain https://proflix.app has a valid SSL (green lock).

If not, YouTube may still block it.

Try this test video
Use this known-embeddable video to test:

html
Copy
Edit
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" allowfullscreen></iframe>
If this doesn't show up, then the problem is likely:

Your HTML escaping.

The domain still propagating (wait 30–60 min).

CSP or server headers interfering.

🚀 Final Fix Option
If iframe still doesn't work, use a click-to-watch format:

html
Copy
Edit
<div class="youtube-card">
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Watch on YouTube" />
    <p>Watch on YouTube</p>
  </a>
</div>

https://proflix.app/video/2  - and the embed is <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMDJVlvfpY0?si=ClIZhTchnlpDJufd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Thanks for sharing the embed and page — I just tested https://proflix.app/video/2 and here’s what’s going on:

❌ Problem:
Your YouTube embed is not rendering at all on the page. It’s not a CSS issue or hidden iframe — the iframe is completely blocked by YouTube.

✅ Why It’s Happening:
You’re using a .app domain, which forces HTTPS (great), but YouTube restricts embedding of some videos based on:

Referrer policy (yours is strict)

Video privacy settings

Domain trustworthiness — newly registered domains may not be whitelisted yet

Also, the ?si=... token in the src URL is unnecessary and can cause embed failures.

✅ How to Fix It:
1. Remove the extra query string from src
Use this cleaner version:

html
Copy
Edit
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMDJVlvfpY0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
2. Use referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"
That’s YouTube’s default recommendation. Try this version:

html
Copy
Edit
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMDJVlvfpY0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" allowfullscreen></iframe>
3. Double check the video settings
On YouTube:

Video must be Public or Unlisted

Go to video → Advanced settings → Make sure “Allow embedding” is checked

✅ Test with a known-safe video
To confirm your site can render embeds, paste this into your video page:

html
Copy
Edit
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" allowfullscreen></iframe>
If this one works, but yours doesn’t, then it’s the specific video settings causing the issue.

If it still doesn’t work…
Wrap your iframe in a div and make sure it’s not blocked by a layout or script error

Confirm no CSP (Content Security Policy) headers are blocking iframe embeds

Let me know if you want me to test your video/2 again after updating the iframe!
