So I've asked Repl.it to create an admin dashboard for me, and it's going to allow me to get a code generator to send out my codes. 99 bucks a month is the Creator Pro. I decided to let anybody become a Creator Pro as long as they have the $99 a month and sell courses. Now, I'm going to be doing $8.97 for a full year, and that is something I'm going to be sending out to thousands of creators just to incentivize them to come post on this website. And that way, I can have that major, major element there. I also haven't asked it yet, but I want to create a referral system where if they refer somebody and they sign up within the next 14 days, the person will also get an additional $8.97 credit for an extra year for somebody who signs up as a pro. And then maybe the pro gets, I don't know, a 90-day trial or something like that for the referral. So besides that, I also want to create— I also asked it to create analytics so that I understand who my top creators are and that I can remove any creator at any time and that type of stuff. And then I also asked it for, yeah, basically analytics, financials, what times of day are the most popular, what creators are the most popular. What else should I ask here?

It's $897 for a 12-month subscription or $99 a month. So that's the Creator Pro account.

You said:
Okay, I also need to ask for the creator's ID to verify that they're 18 plus, and also just so that I have their ID and everything. So that's something that I want to do. And then I also want to have like, you know, a little bit more information about what's in their video. Like they can't have anything like homophobic or sexist or racist or, you know, that would prevent people from, you know, disabilities for, you know, doing what they're doing, et cetera. So, you know, that kind of stuff just for some legal protection and that they are taking full liability for whatever's in their videos, that we're not liable for any of it, that they claim that they're an industry expert and that we are, you know, allowing them to come on our platform as an industry expert in order to teach and sell courses.


ChatGPT said:
Perfect — this is a critical compliance and liability protection layer for your platform. Here's exactly how to instruct Replit to implement it, both on the technical side and in terms of legal protection.

✅ Creator Verification & Compliance Requirements for ProFlix
🔐 These should be implemented in the Creator onboarding flow and admin panel.

🪪 1. Government ID Verification (18+)
Step in Creator Pro signup (mandatory before uploading or selling content).

Fields to collect:

Full legal name

Date of birth

Upload government-issued photo ID (passport, driver’s license, etc.)

Selfie with ID (optional but ideal for fraud prevention)

Store securely with limited access (use encrypted cloud storage, NOT public S3).

Admin dashboard must show uploaded ID files for verification or audit.

Optional: Integrate with 3rd-party age/identity verification APIs later (e.g. Stripe Identity, Persona, or IDVerify).

📜 2. Legal Acknowledgement & Creator Agreement
Replit should build a mandatory e-signature step (or checkbox with timestamp) in the Creator onboarding flow:

Legal Terms Creators Must Agree To:
✅ I certify I am at least 18 years old.

✅ I am the original creator and owner of all videos I upload.

✅ I agree not to post any content that:

Contains racist, sexist, or homophobic language

Promotes violence or illegal activities

Discriminates against individuals based on disability, gender, race, or religion

✅ I understand I am solely responsible for the content I publish.

✅ I represent myself as an industry expert or qualified educator.

✅ I acknowledge that ProFlix is not liable for the accuracy, safety, or results of my teachings.

✅ I release and indemnify ProFlix from any legal claims resulting from my content.

📍This agreement must be stored with:

Timestamp

IP address (for legal backup)

Associated user ID

📦 3. Video Upload Metadata & Compliance Review
Every uploaded video must include:

✅ Title

✅ Description

✅ Category

✅ Tags (at least 3)

✅ Checkbox: “This video complies with ProFlix community standards.”

✅ Optional: “Mark as sensitive content” (flagged for manual admin review)

Admin panel should show upload queue and allow flagging or removal.

🧠 Bonus: Suggested Admin Dashboard Features
Flag videos for review (community or auto-detection in the future)

Ban or suspend users who violate content rules

View ID verification status

Search/filter users by:
