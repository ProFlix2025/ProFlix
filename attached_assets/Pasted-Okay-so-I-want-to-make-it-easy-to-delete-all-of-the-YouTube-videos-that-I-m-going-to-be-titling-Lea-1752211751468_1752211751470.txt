Okay, so I want to make it easy to delete all of the YouTube videos that I'm going to be titling LearnTube on this website. Basically, I don't want to make it so that it's... I want to make it so that it's easily deletable. Basically, all of the YouTube content can just delete in one folder off of my website when I'm ready to delete all of the YouTube content. We only have one small section that will say LearnTube, and that's where all of the YouTube content will be. So, I want to create it so that it can easily be deleted. So, I'm going to have two YouTube-style websites all on one website, and I want it to be mixed. Our content we can run ads on, but YouTube content we can't. So, the videos need to go into two different folders. Once I get to enough videos, let's say I get to 10 or 20,000 videos, I can delete all of the YouTube content off of my website. But for now, I need it in order to make my website look a lot more usable and complete.

Great strategy. Here’s a clean and scalable way to implement your "LearnTube" (YouTube content) section so it can be easily deleted later without affecting your premium or original content.

✅ GOAL:
Keep YouTube content isolated under one section (/learntube)

Allow for easy deletion later by removing one folder or entry

Keep ProFlix content separate (e.g., paid uploads, Pro Creator content)

🧩 Recommended File + Folder Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
/public
  /assets
  /videos
    /learntube       ← 💥 YouTube videos stored here (easy to delete)
    /proflix         ← Your original or paid content

/src
  /routes
    learntube.ts     ← Renders all LearnTube content
    proflix.ts       ← Renders all original content

  /components
    LearntubePlayer.tsx
    ProflixPlayer.tsx

/database
  /learnTubeVideos.json  ← Metadata for YouTube videos
  /proflixVideos.json    ← Metadata for uploaded ProFlix videos
🧹 To Delete LearnTube in the Future
When you’re ready to remove all YouTube content:

Delete the /videos/learntube/ folder

Delete the /routes/learntube.ts file

Remove any links or buttons that point to /learntube

Delete learnTubeVideos.json from the DB or storage

Optional: Remove the “LearnTube” section from homepage navigation or layout

This wipes all traces of YouTube content cleanly.

🧠 Bonus Tips
1. Tag Content by Source
Add a source: "learntube" or "proflix" field in your DB schema:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "123abc",
  "title": "How to start freelancing",
  "source": "learntube",
  "videoUrl": "/videos/learntube/freelance-start.mp4"
}
You can filter by source on the front end or admin dashboard and even show a toggle:

“Hide 3rd Party Videos”

2. Ad Display Control
You can easily check in your front-end logic:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (video.source === 'proflix') {
  showAdPlayer(video)
} else {
  showBasicPlayer(video)
}
3. Future-Proof SEO
Use canonical tags or noindex headers on YouTube pages if you don’t want search engines indexing LearnTube videos:

html
Copy
Edit
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
