You’ve made huge progress and have almost everything in place — but now is the most dangerous time in a build: when it looks complete but still has hidden risks that could break in production.

Here’s a clear list of potential problems you should watch for — and exactly what to do to prevent them:

⚠️ 1. Legal & Compliance Oversight
🚩 Problem:
Your platform is now collecting ID data and allowing public course sales. Without legal structure, you're exposed to liability and privacy violations (especially in EU/CA states with GDPR/CCPA laws).

✅ Fix:
Draft and link these legal docs before launch:

✅ Privacy Policy

✅ Terms of Use (clearly disclaims liability)

✅ Creator Agreement (signed digitally)

Add a checkbox + timestamp consent to the Creator Verification form

If storing IDs, use secure cloud storage with encryption (e.g., AWS S3 w/ private ACL)

⚠️ 2. Security & Abuse Prevention
🚩 Problem:
If anyone can upload, malicious users might:

Upload pirated content or illegal material

Spam videos to game the system

Sell fake or misleading courses

✅ Fix:
Add manual approval for new Creator Pro accounts (optional)

Add a “Report Video” feature for users

Limit video upload rate (e.g., max 3/day)

Log IP address & user agent during uploads and course purchases

⚠️ 3. Storage & Bandwidth Overload
🚩 Problem:
Hosting user-uploaded videos yourself (not on YouTube/CDN) could crash the app or run up Render/storage costs quickly.

✅ Fix:
Offload video uploads to:

🟢 Mux (best choice for monetized video platforms)

🟡 Vimeo Pro

🔴 At minimum: AWS S3 + Cloudfront

Ensure all uploads are streamed (not downloaded)

⚠️ 4. Payment System Fraud or Failure
🚩 Problem:
Without webhook validation, Stripe payments may fail silently or get spoofed.

✅ Fix:
Add Stripe webhook validation (/api/webhooks/stripe)

Log all payment success/failures

Cancel Pro access if payment fails

Mark Stripe IDs in the database per user

⚠️ 5. Scaling Risks
🚩 Problem:
If you go viral or onboard 500+ creators quickly:

DB queries might become slow

Static hosting or Render instance might time out or go over memory

✅ Fix:
Add indexing to the users, videos, and sales tables

Use a logging system (e.g. Logtail or LogRocket)

Enable lazy loading and pagination in admin pages

Auto-backup your DB weekly via Render settings

⚠️ 6. No Email Verification or Login Limits
🚩 Problem:
Anyone can create fake accounts with disposable emails or brute-force login

✅ Fix:
Add email verification during signup

Add rate-limiting or captcha to login/signup forms

Add admin ability to ban emails/IPs

⚠️ 7. Lack of Unit Tests or Deployment Tests
🚩 Problem:
You have no automated test coverage. One change could silently break something (e.g. code gen, Stripe, creator uploads).

✅ Fix:
Add one test file for:

Creator Pro purchase

Course upload

Admin removal

Use something like Vitest or Jest for quick test coverage

🛡️ Final Suggestions:
Create a staging subdomain (staging.proflix.app) before fully going live.

Write an onboarding guide for your future VA/moderator team to review videos, verify IDs, and approve new creators.

Test the full funnel from:

Visiting as a guest → watching video

Upgrading to Creator Pro → uploading video → buying course
